# Pixel-Volume-Panel-Tile
This is a simple method to add a "Volume Panel" for people who don't like to always use the volume buttons on their pixel phones.

## Steps:
1. Download *QuickTiles* from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.asdoi.quicktiles/).
2. Install the app and give permission to modify system settings (afaik Accessibility permission isn't needed for volume panel tile)
3. Turn on `Volume Panel`
4. Go to Edit button and find `Volume Panel` tile from below and rearrange wherever you want.

_Tested on Pixel 7 running Android 15_
